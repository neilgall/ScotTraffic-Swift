ScotTraffic is back! Completely rewritten for newer devices running iOS 8 and above, but the same ease of use you know and love. View Traffic Scotland camera images in near real-time, find out about roadworks and traffic incidents, and pinpoint the location of safety cameras all over Scotland. Local weather conditions and temperature are shown at every location. With ScotTraffic 2 you can save your favourite camera locations for quick access to the latest images, and share camera images and up-to-date traffic information by email, message or social media.

A few features from the old app are not yet supported - for example, notifications for the Forth and Tay Road bridges - but these and more are coming soon.

ScotTraffic is designed for quick access to road travel information, but please keep all Scotland's road users safe by not using your mobile device while driving.
