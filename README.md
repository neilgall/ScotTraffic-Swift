# ScotTraffic-Swift

This is the last working version of ScotTraffic in Swift. I pushed the boundaries of Swift 2 a bit
and don't think I ever got it fully ported to Swift 3. I have no idea what the Swift 4 and beyond
compilers will make of it. But it's now public domain and free to do with as you wish.

The accompanying server components are in their own repository at https://github.com/neilgall/ScotTraffic-Server
